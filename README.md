# MATLAB
Worked in collaboration to develop 3+ 60-minute interactive programs (mainly displaying specific sequences of texts and images) to conduct psychological research with Professor Nada Attar.
Incorporated a TobiiPro eye tracker to measure gaze patterns, pupil dilations, response times, etc in participants.
Explored the effects of auditory signals on response times, influence of subconscious bias and training on art analysis, and the relationship between visual patterns and working memory load through the programs developed.
Included are a few of the many files associated with this project- I mainly uploaded aspects that I contributed heavily to.
